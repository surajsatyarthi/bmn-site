# UI/UX Improvements & Branding Standardization

In addition to the core S0.1 deliverables, the following visual improvements were implemented:

## 1. Global Gradient Standardization
- **Unified Brand Color**: Defined `--gradient-primary` in `globals.css` matching the "Get Started" button.
- **Logo Consistency**: Updated the "BMN" text logo in Auth, Dashboard, and Onboarding layouts to use the gradient (replacing flat blue).
- **Iconography**: Implemented a global SVG definition to apply the gradient to all Lucide icons via `.icon-gradient-primary`.
- **Text & Links**: Primary links and headings now use `.text-gradient-primary`.
- **Buttons**: All primary buttons standardized to use the brand gradient with consistent hover states.

## 2. Branding Assets
- **Favicon**: Deployed high-resolution favicon with correct transparency.
- **404 Page**: Fixed broken logo image and matched background color (`#fafbfc`) to eliminate visual artifacts.
- **Email/Auth Templates**: Updated logo references to use the new standardized assets.

## 3. Evidence
- See `screenshot-ui-gradient.png` for verification of the logo and button gradient consistency on the Login page.
- See `screenshot-404.png` for the fixed 404 page branding.
