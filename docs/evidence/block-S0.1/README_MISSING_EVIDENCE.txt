Authenticated evidence (Rate Limit Test, Dashboard Screenshots, Error Boundary) could not be collected because the local Supabase instance is disconnected, preventing login/signup.

- rate-limit-test.txt: SKIPPED (Requires valid auth token)
- screenshot-loading-dashboard.png: SKIPPED (Redirects to login)
- screenshot-error-boundary.png: SKIPPED (Cannot access dashboard)
