# Free Chat Widget Alternatives for BMN

## Goal
Find a free, "always-available" live chat widget to replace Gleap, ensuring support is accessible to users without incurring monthly costs.

## Top Recommendations

### 1. Tawk.to (Best "Truly Free" Option)
- **Cost:** $0 / month (Forever)
- **Limits:** Unlimited agents, unlimited chats, unlimited websites.
- **Pros:** Completely free, real-time monitoring, mobile app.
- **Cons:** Outdated UI, "Powered by tawk.to" branding (paid removal).
- **Verdict:** Best for zero budget if you don't mind the branding.

### 2. Crisp (Best UX/UI)
- **Cost:** Free plan available.
- **Limits:** 2 seats, unlimited chats.
- **Pros:** Modern design, specific "Status" page, mobile app.
- **Cons:** Limited integrations on free plan.
- **Verdict:** Best balance of design and free features for a small team.

### 3. HubSpot Chat (Best for CRM Integration)
- **Cost:** Free (part of CRM).
- **Limits:** Unlimited chats, but ties into HubSpot ecosystem.
- **Pros:** Automatically captures leads into CRM, chatbots available.
- **Cons:** Overkill if just needing simple chat.
- **Verdict:** Use if you plan to use HubSpot for sales/marketing.

## Supporting Research
- **Gleap** is powerful but strictly paid for production use after trial.
- **ManyReach** (competitor) uses Gleap, likely on a paid plan.
- **Recommendation:** Switch to **Crisp** for a modern feel that matches BMN's design, or **Tawk.to** if you need unlimited seats immediately.
