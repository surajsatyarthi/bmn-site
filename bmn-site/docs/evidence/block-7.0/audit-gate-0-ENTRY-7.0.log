# Gate 0 Audit Log - ENTRY-7.0 (Block 7.0 User Dashboard)

## Gate 1: Physical Audit & State
- Checked `src/app/(dashboard)` directory.
- Currently contains basic routes for `matches`, `profile`, `campaigns`.
- The `layout.tsx` for the dashboard exists but needs to be enhanced with a modern Sidebar/TopNav structure using Radix UI primitives.

## Gate 2: Logic Mapping & Research

### Mandatory Web Searches Completed:
1. **Best practices for building a B2B SaaS dashboard using Next.js App Router and Radix UI**
   - *Findings:* Use Feature-based organization. Colocate components. Use Route Groups (like we have with `(dashboard)`). Layered layouts are key. Radix UI provides accessible headless primitives that integrate perfectly with Tailwind.
2. **Next.js server vs client component performance optimization for dashboard data fetching**
   - *Findings:* Default to Server Components. Fetch data server-side (like Profile data, match statistics) to reduce JS bundle size. Only use `"use client"` for interactive widgets (like chart toggles or complex forms).
3. **Modern UX patterns for SaaS user dashboards layout and navigation**
   - *Findings:* Overview-first approach (3-5 key metrics at top). Card-based layouts. Progressive disclosure. Minimal top-level menus with side panels. Consistent typography and whitespace.

### Dependency Analysis
- **Radix UI components:** We are already using `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `react-tabs`, `react-dialog`, `react-avatar`. We may need to install `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` or others if necessary for the sidebar profile dropdown, but we will check `package.json` first.
- **Lucide-React:** We have `lucide-react` for icons.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Fully configured for layout grids and flexbox.

### Edge Cases Identified
- Responsive design: The sidebar needs to collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.
- Data fetching loading states: Server components taking too long to fetch matches/campaigns means we need `loading.tsx` and `<Suspense>` boundaries to prevent blocking the whole dashboard render.
- Empty states: What does the dashboard look like when a user just signed up and has 0 matches and 0 campaigns? Need to design inviting empty state CTAs.
